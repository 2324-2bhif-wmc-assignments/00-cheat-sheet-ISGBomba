        <p class="questions">What is a web server?</p>
        A web server is a software application or hardware device that serves as the foundation for the
        World Wide Web (WWW) by responding to requests from clients, typically web browsers, and delivering web content
        to those clients over the internet. In simpler terms, it's a specialized computer program or hardware system
        that
        stores, processes, and serves web pages, files, and other resources to users when they access websites.
        Characteristic examples:
        <li>Handling Client Requests</li>
        <li>Content Storage</li>
        <li>Content Processing</li>

    <section id="WebserverDoQuestion" class="answers">
        <p class="questions">What does a web server?</p>
        A web server performs several critical functions to facilitate the delivery of web content
        and services to clients (typically web browsers) over the internet. <br />
        Examples:
        <li>Listens for Incoming Requests: A web server constantly listens for incoming HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
            Protocol)
            or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) requests from clients.</li>
        <li>Processes Client Requests: When a request is received, the web server processes it
            based on the URL and requested resource.</li>
        <li>Retrieves Web Content: For static resources like HTML files, images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files,
            the web server retrieves these files from its storage or file system and sends them back to the client.</li>
        <li>Dynamic Content Generation: Web servers can execute server-side scripts written in programming languages
            like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js</li>
        <li>HTTP(S) Communication: Web servers communicate with clients using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols.</li>
        <li>Handling Authentication and Sessions: Web servers can implement user authentication mechanisms
            to secure access to certain resources.</li>
        <li>Content Compression and Caching: To optimize performance, web servers can compress content before
            sending it to clients, reducing bandwidth usage</li>
        <li>Virtual Hosting: Web servers support virtual hosting, allowing multiple websites to share the same
            server while appearing as separate entities.</li>
        <li>Load Balancing: In high-traffic scenarios or for redundancy, web servers can work
            together in a cluster or farm.</li>
        <li>Logging and Monitoring: Web servers often log information about each request and server activity.</li>
        <li>Security: Web servers implement various security measures to protect against common threats like
            DDoS attacks, injection attacks, and unauthorized access.</li>
    </section>
    <section id="ContentStoredQuestion" class="answers">
        <p class="questions">How can content be stored on a web server?</p>
        Content is stored on a web server in the form of files and directories within the server's file system.
        The organization and management of content on a web server are critical for efficient web hosting. <br />
        Here's how content can be stored on a web server:
        <li>File System Structure: Web servers typically have a directory structure where content is stored.</li>
        <li>Static Files: Static web content, such as HTML files, images, stylesheets (CSS), JavaScript files,
            and downloadable documents (PDFs, text files), is stored directly in the appropriate directory within
            the server's file system. </li>
        <li>Dynamic Content: Dynamic content, which is generated on-the-fly in response to user requests,
            is often stored in a database or generated by server-side scripts.</li>
        <li>Content Management Systems (CMS): Many websites use Content Management Systems like WordPress,
            Drupal, or Joomla.</li>
        <li>Media Files: For multimedia content like videos and audio files, web servers store these files in
            directories,
            often with subdirectories for different types of media.</li>
        <li>User Uploads: Websites that allow user-generated content often have directories to store user uploads,
            such as profile pictures, user-submitted images, and documents.</li>
        <li>Caching: Some web servers implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed content in a cache.</li>
        <li>Content Versioning: Web developers may use version control systems like Git to store and manage
            website source code, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</li>
        <li>Backup and Redundancy: To ensure data integrity and availability, web server administrators
            often perform regular backups of web content.</li>
        <li>Content Security: Proper access control measures are essential to protect content on a web server.</li>
    </section>
    <section id="ContentDescribedQuestion" class="answers">
        <p class="questions">How is content in webpages described?</p>
        Content in webpages is described using a combination of technologies and standards that define the structure,
        presentation, and functionality of the content. <br />
        The primary technologies and methods used to describe content in webpages include:
        <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): HTML is the core language used to describe the structure and content of
            webpages.</li>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): CSS is used to describe the presentation and styling of HTML elements.</li>
        <li>JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to webpages.
        </li>
        <li>Meta Data: Metadata is used to provide additional information about a webpage.</li>
        <li>Structured Data: Structured data formats like JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) or
            Microdata
            are used to mark up specific pieces of content with semantic meaning.</li>
        <li>Accessibility Markup: Web developers use HTML elements and attributes to enhance web accessibility.</li>
        <li>Web Components: Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow developers to create reusable
            custom HTML
            elements with encapsulated functionality and styling. </li>

    <p class="subheaders">Web Client</p>
    <section id="WebClientQuestion" class="answers">
        <p class="questions">What is a web client?</p>
        A web client, often simply referred to as a "client," is a software application or user agent that interacts
        with web servers over the internet. Web clients are responsible for making requests to web servers and receiving
        and rendering the content returned by those servers. They play a central role in the World Wide Web ecosystem by
        allowing users to access and interact with web content and services.
        Here are some key characteristics and examples of web clients:
        <li>User Interface: Web clients typically have a user interface (UI) that allows users to input web addresses
            (URLs),
            interact with web content, and navigate websites. </li>
        <li>Requesting Web Content: When a user enters a URL or clicks on a hyperlink, the web client sends a request to
            the appropriate web server to retrieve the requested web content.</li>
        <li>Rendering Web Content: Once the web client receives the content from the server, it renders the
            content for display to the user.</li>
        <li>Interactivity: Web clients enable users to interact with web content, such as submitting forms,
            clicking on links, playing videos, and performing various actions on web applications. </li>
    </section>
    <section id="WebClientDoesQuestion" class="answers">
        <p class="questions">What does a web client?</p>
        A web client, often referred to simply as a "client," is a software application or user agent
        that interacts with web servers over the internet. Its primary function is to request and receive
        web content and services from web servers and render or display that content to the user. Web clients
        are an integral part of the World Wide Web and enable users to access, view, and interact with web content.
        Here's what a web client does:
        <li>Initiates Requests: A web client initiates requests to web servers by sending HTTP
            (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) requests.</li>
        <li>Handles Responses: When a web server receives a request, it processes it and sends back
            a response to the web client.</li>
        <li>Renders Content: The web client interprets and renders the received content for display to the user.</li>
        <li>Provides User Interface: Most web clients have a graphical user interface (UI) that
            allows users to interact with web content.</li>
        <li>Manages User Input: Web clients handle user input, including keyboard and mouse interactions.</li>
        <li>Supports Interactivity: Web clients enable interactivity on webpages and web applications
            by executing JavaScript code.</li>
        <li>Stores Data: Web clients can store temporary data, such as cookies, web storage, and caches,
            to improve performance and maintain session information.</li>
        <li>Manages Cookies and Sessions: Web clients send and receive cookies, which are small pieces
            of data used for tracking user sessions and storing user-related information. </li>
        <li>Ensures Security: Web clients implement security measures, such as supporting HTTPS to
            encrypt data in transit, handling secure authentication and authorization, and protecting
            against security threats like cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).</li>
        <li>Supports Accessibility: Many web clients are designed to support web accessibility standards,
            ensuring that web content is usable by individuals with disabilities.</li>

    <section id="HTMLTagQuestion" class="answers">
        <p class="questions">What is the html head element?</p>
        The HTML &lt;head&gt; element is a crucial part of an HTML document. It doesn't represent visible
        content on a web page but instead contains meta-information, links to external resources,
        and other essential elements that provide information about the document itself or control
        how the document is displayed or processed. The &lt;head&gt; element is typically placed
        within the &lt;html&gt; element, before the &lt;body&gt; element
    </section>
    <section id="DoctypeQuestion" class="answers">
        <p class="questions">What does &lt;!DOCTYPE` html&gt; mean?</p>
        The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration is an important instruction at the beginning of an HTML
        document that specifies the version of HTML being used and helps the web browser understand
        how to interpret and render the content of the page. It is a required element in HTML documents.
    </section>
    <section id="TopMostElements" class="answers">
        <p class="questions">What are the two top most elements within the html element?</p>
        <li> &lt;head&gt; Element: This element contains metadata about the document and other elements
            that control how the document is processed or displayed.</li>
        <li> &lt;body&gt; Element: This element contains the visible content of the web page, such as text,
        images, links, forms, and other elements that users interact with.</li>
    </section>
    <section id="EmphasizeQuestion">
        <p class="questions">How to emphasize a text and how is it displayed in the browser?</p>
        In HTML, you can emphasize or highlight text using the &lt;em&gt; element or the &lt;strong&gt; element,
        depending on the level of emphasis you want to apply. These elements are used to indicate
        semantic importance and provide a way for web browsers and assistive technologies to understand
        the intended level of emphasis.<br/>
        In the browser, this would typically be displayed as: "This is <em>emphasized</em> text."
    </section>
    <section id="MarkQuestion" class="answers">
        <p class="question">How to mark up important ext and how is it displayed in the browser?</p>
        In HTML, you can mark up important text using the &lt;mark&gt; element. The &lt;mark&gt; element is used to
        highlight or "mark" a portion of text as important or relevant within the context of the content.
        When used, browsers typically render the marked text with a yellow background by default,
        but you can style it further using CSS if needed. <br/>
        In the browser, the text "important" would typically be displayed with a yellow background, like this:

        "This is some <mark>important</mark> text."
