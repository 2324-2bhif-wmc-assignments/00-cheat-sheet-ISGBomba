        <h2 class="questions">What is a web server?</h2>
        A web server is a software application or hardware device that serves as the foundation for the
        World Wide Web (WWW) by responding to requests from clients, typically web browsers, and delivering web
        content
        to those clients over the internet. In simpler terms, it's a specialized computer program or hardware system
        that
        stores, processes, and serves web pages, files, and other resources to users when they access websites.
        Characteristic examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Handling Client Requests</li>
            <li>Content Storage</li>
            <li>Content Processing</li>

        <h2 class="questions">What does a web server?</h2>
        A web server performs several critical functions to facilitate the delivery of web content
        and services to clients (typically web browsers) over the internet. <br />
        Examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Listens for Incoming Requests: A web server constantly listens for incoming HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
                Protocol)
                or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) requests from clients.</li>
            <li>Processes Client Requests: When a request is received, the web server processes it
                based on the URL and requested resource.</li>
            <li>Retrieves Web Content: For static resources like HTML files, images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files,
                the web server retrieves these files from its storage or file system and sends them back to the client.
            </li>
            <li>Dynamic Content Generation: Web servers can execute server-side scripts written in programming languages
                like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js</li>
            <li>HTTP(S) Communication: Web servers communicate with clients using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols.</li>
            <li>Handling Authentication and Sessions: Web servers can implement user authentication mechanisms
                to secure access to certain resources.</li>
            <li>Content Compression and Caching: To optimize performance, web servers can compress content before
                sending it to clients, reducing bandwidth usage</li>
            <li>Virtual Hosting: Web servers support virtual hosting, allowing multiple websites to share the same
                server while appearing as separate entities.</li>
            <li>Load Balancing: In high-traffic scenarios or for redundancy, web servers can work
                together in a cluster or farm.</li>
            <li>Logging and Monitoring: Web servers often log information about each request and server activity.</li>
            <li>Security: Web servers implement various security measures to protect against common threats like
                DDoS attacks, injection attacks, and unauthorized access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="questions">How can content be stored on a web server?</h2>
        Content is stored on a web server in the form of files and directories within the server's file system.
        The organization and management of content on a web server are critical for efficient web hosting. <br />
        Here's how content can be stored on a web server:
        <ul>
            <li>File System Structure: Web servers typically have a directory structure where content is stored.</li>
            <li>Static Files: Static web content, such as HTML files, images, stylesheets (CSS), JavaScript files,
                and downloadable documents (PDFs, text files), is stored directly in the appropriate directory within
                the server's file system. </li>
            <li>Dynamic Content: Dynamic content, which is generated on-the-fly in response to user requests,
                is often stored in a database or generated by server-side scripts.</li>
            <li>Content Management Systems (CMS): Many websites use Content Management Systems like WordPress,
                Drupal, or Joomla.</li>
            <li>Media Files: For multimedia content like videos and audio files, web servers store these files in
                directories,
                often with subdirectories for different types of media.</li>
            <li>User Uploads: Websites that allow user-generated content often have directories to store user uploads,
                such as profile pictures, user-submitted images, and documents.</li>
            <li>Caching: Some web servers implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed content in a cache.
            </li>
            <li>Content Versioning: Web developers may use version control systems like Git to store and manage
                website source code, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</li>
            <li>Backup and Redundancy: To ensure data integrity and availability, web server administrators
                often perform regular backups of web content.</li>
            <li>Content Security: Proper access control measures are essential to protect content on a web server.</li>

        <h2 class="questions">What is a web client?</h2>
        A web client, often simply referred to as a "client," is a software application or user agent that interacts
        with web servers over the internet. Web clients are responsible for making requests to web servers and
        receiving
        and rendering the content returned by those servers. They play a central role in the World Wide Web
        ecosystem by
        allowing users to access and interact with web content and services.
        Here are some key characteristics and examples of web clients:
        <ul>
            <li>User Interface: Web clients typically have a user interface (UI) that allows users to input web
                addresses
                (URLs),
                interact with web content, and navigate websites. </li>
            <li>Requesting Web Content: When a user enters a URL or clicks on a hyperlink, the web client sends a
                request to
                the appropriate web server to retrieve the requested web content.</li>
            <li>Rendering Web Content: Once the web client receives the content from the server, it renders the
                content for display to the user.</li>
            <li>Interactivity: Web clients enable users to interact with web content, such as submitting forms,
                clicking on links, playing videos, and performing various actions on web applications. </li>

        <h2 class="questions">What does a web client?</h2>
        A web client, often referred to simply as a "client," is a software application or user agent
        that interacts with web servers over the internet. Its primary function is to request and receive
        web content and services from web servers and render or display that content to the user. Web clients
        are an integral part of the World Wide Web and enable users to access, view, and interact with web content.
        Here's what a web client does:
        <ul>
            <li>Initiates Requests: A web client initiates requests to web servers by sending HTTP
                (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) requests.</li>
            <li>Handles Responses: When a web server receives a request, it processes it and sends back
                a response to the web client.</li>
            <li>Renders Content: The web client interprets and renders the received content for display to the user.
            </li>
            <li>Provides User Interface: Most web clients have a graphical user interface (UI) that
                allows users to interact with web content.</li>
            <li>Manages User Input: Web clients handle user input, including keyboard and mouse interactions.</li>
            <li>Supports Interactivity: Web clients enable interactivity on webpages and web applications
                by executing JavaScript code.</li>
            <li>Stores Data: Web clients can store temporary data, such as cookies, web storage, and caches,
                to improve performance and maintain session information.</li>
            <li>Manages Cookies and Sessions: Web clients send and receive cookies, which are small pieces
                of data used for tracking user sessions and storing user-related information. </li>
            <li>Ensures Security: Web clients implement security measures, such as supporting HTTPS to
                encrypt data in transit, handling secure authentication and authorization, and protecting
                against security threats like cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).</li>
            <li>Supports Accessibility: Many web clients are designed to support web accessibility standards,
                ensuring that web content is usable by individuals with disabilities.</li>

    <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
    <p>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</p></li>
        <li><p>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</p></li>

    <p class="questions">2. element Selector</p>
    <p>The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.</p>
    <p class="questions">3. Grouping Selector</p>
    <p>The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.</p>
    <p>It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.</p>
    <p>To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.</p>
    <pre>

    <p class="questions">HEX Colors</p>
    <p>A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.</p>
    <h4>2.1 HEX Value</h4>
    <p>In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:</p>
    <p class="bold">#rrggbb</p>
    <p>Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).</p>
    <p>For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).</p>
    <p>To display black, set all values to 00, like this: #000000.</p>
    <p>To display white, set all values to ff, like this: #ffffff.  </p>
    <h4>2.2 3 Digit HEX Value</h4>
    <p>Sometimes you will see a 3-digit hex code in the CSS source.</p>
    <p>The 3-digit hex code is a shorthand for some 6-digit hex codes.</p>
    <p>The 3-digit hex code has the following form:</p>
    <p class="bold">#rgb</p>
    <p>Where r, g, and b represent the red, green, and blue components with values between 0 and f.</p>
    <p>The 3-digit hex code can only be used when both the values (RR, GG, and BB) are the same for each component. So, if we have #ff00cc, it can be written like this: #f0c.</p>
    <p class="subheaders">Background</p>
    <p>The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.</p>
    <p class="questions">background-color</p>
    <p>The 'background-color' property specifies the background color of an element.</p>
    <p>With CSS, a color is most often specified by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>a valid color name - like "red"</p></li>
        <li><p>a HEX value - like "#ff0000"</p></li>
        <li><p>an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="questions">background-image</p>
    <p>The 'background-image' property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.</p>
    <p>By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.</p>
    <p>The background image can also be set for specific elements, like the &lt;p&gt; element</p>
    <p class="questions">Repeat Horizontally or Vertically</p>
    <p>By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.</p>
    <p>Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange</p>
    <p>If the image above is repeated only horizontally '(background-repeat: repeat-x;)', the background will look better</p>
    <p class="questions">Fixed Position</p>
    <p>Showing the background image only once is also specified by the 'background-repeat' property</p>

    <p class="subheaders">Text</p>
    <p>CSS has a lot of properties for formatting text.</p>

    <p class="questions">Text Color</p>
    <p>The 'color' property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>a color name - like "red"</p></li>
        <li><p>a HEX value - like "#ff0000"</p></li>
        <li><p>an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.</p>

    <p class="questions">Text Alignment</p>
    <p>The 'text-align' property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.</p>
    <p>A text can be left or right aligned, centered, or justified.</p>
    <p>When the 'text-align' property is set to "justify", each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, and the left and right margins are straight (like in magazines and newspapers).</p>
    <p>The 'text-align-last' property specifies how to align the last line of a text.</p>
    <p>The 'direction and unicode-bidi properties can be used to change the text direction of an element</p>
    <p>The 'vertical-align' property sets the vertical alignment of an element.</p>

    <p class="questions">Text Decoration</p>
    <p>The 'text-decoration-line' property is used to add a decoration line to text.</p>
    <p>You can combine more than one value, like overline and underline to display lines both over and under a text.</p>
    <p>The 'text-decoration-color' property is used to set the color of the decoration line.</p>
    <p>The text-decoration-style property is used to set the style of the decoration line.</p>
    <p>The text-decoration-thickness property is used to set the thickness of the decoration line.</p>
    <p>All links in HTML are underlined by default. Sometimes you see that links are styled with no underline. The text-decoration: none; is used to remove the underline from links</p>

    <p class="questions">Text Transformation</p>
    <p>The 'text-transform' property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.</p>
    <p>It can be used to turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalize the first letter of each word.</p>

    <p class="subheaders">Fonts</p>
    <p>Choosing the right font for your website is important!</p>

    <p class="questions">Difference Between Serif and Sans-serif Fonts</p>
    <p>On computer screens, sans-serif fonts are considered easier to read than serif fonts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>serif: fine lines at the ends of each letter</p></li>
        <li><p>sans-serif: Fonts without lines</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="questions">font-family</p>
    <p>In CSS, we use the font-family property to specify the font of a text.</p>
    <p>If the font name is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".</p>
    <p>
        The 'font-family' property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum
        compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic
        family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available).
        The font names should be separated with comma.
    </p>

    <p class="questions">Font Style </p>
    <p>The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text.</p>
    <p>This property has three values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>normal - The text is shown normally</p></li>
        <li><p>italic - The text is shown in italics</p></li>
        <li><p>oblique - The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The 'font-weight' property specifies the weight of a font.</p>
    <p>The 'font-variant' property specifies whether or not a text should be displayed in a small-caps font.</p>
    <p>
        In a small-caps font, all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase letters. However, the converted
        uppercase letters appears in a smaller font size than the original uppercase letters in the text.
    </p>

    <p class="questions">Font Size</p>
    <p>The 'font-size' property sets the size of the text.</p>
    <p>
        Being able to manage the text size is important in web design.
        However, you should not use font size adjustments to make
        paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs.
    </p>
    <p>Always use the proper HTML tags, like &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt; for headings and &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs.</p>
    <p>The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.</p>
    <p>Absolute size:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Sets the text to a specified size.</p></li>
        <li><p>Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)</p></li>
        <li><p>Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Relative size:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Sets the size relative to surrounding elements.</p></li>
        <li><p>Allows a user to change the text size in browsers.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do not specify a font size, the default size for normal text, like paragraphs, is 16px (16px=1em).</p>
    <p class="bold">Set Font Size With Pixels:</p>
    <p>Setting the text size with pixels gives you full control over the text size.</p>
    <p class="bold">Set Font Size With Em</p>
    <p>To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), many developers use em instead of pixels.</p>
    <p>1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.</p>
    <p>The size can be calculated from pixels to em using this formula: pixels/16=em</p>
    <p>The text size can be set with a vw unit, which means the "viewport width".</p>
    <p>That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window.</p>

    <p class="questions">font-weight</p>
    <p>the 'font-weight' property sets how thick or thin characters in text should be displayed.</p>

    <p class="subheaders">Link</p>
    <p>Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g. 'color', 'font-family', 'background', etc.).</p>
    <p>In addition, links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.</p>
    <p>The four links states are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>'a:link' - a normal, unvisited link</p></li>
        <li><p>'a:visited' - a link the user has visited</p></li>
        <li><p>'a:hover' - a link when the user mouses over it</p></li>
        <li><p>'a:active' - a link the moment it is clicked</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited</p></li>
        <li><p>a:active MUST come after a:hover</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="subheaders">Combinators</p>
    <p>A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.</p>
    <p>There are four different combinators in CSS:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>descendant selector (space)</p></li>
        <li><p>child selector (>)</p></li>
        <li><p>adjacent sibling selector (+)</p></li>
        <li><p>general sibling selector (~)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="questions">Descendant Selector</p>
    <p>The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.</p>

    <p class="questions">Child Selector (>)</p>
    <p>The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.</p>

    <p class="questions">Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</p>
    <p>The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</p>
    <p>Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".</p>

    <p class="questions">General Sibling Selector (~)</p>
    <p>The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.</p>

    <p class="subheaders">Pseudo-Class</p>
    <p>A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.</p>
    <p>For example, it can be used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Style an element when a user mouses over it</p></li>
        <li><p>Style visited and unvisited links differently</p></li>
        <li><p>Style an element when it gets focus</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="questions">Syntax</p>
    <pre>
        selector:pseudo-class {
            property: value;
        }
    </pre>

    <p class="questions">Anchor Pseudo-classes</p>
    <p>Links can be displayed in different ways.</p>
    <p>
        'a:hover' MUST come after 'a:link' and 'a:visited' in the CSS definition in order to be effective!
        'a:active' MUST come after 'a:hover' in the CSS definition in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.
    </p>

    <p class="questions">The :first-child Pseudo-class </p>
    <p>The :first-child pseudo-class matches a specified element that is the first child of another element.</p>
